I would turn on our big, beige Dell PC and tap on those old keyboards, mostly because I loved how those keys felt. What started out with short stories on MS Word about ghosts hanging from balconies,
                    eventually turned into a WordPress blog, where I still post whatever mediocre word vomit I can conjure up.  This writing thing, finally turned into content writing here and there-because capitalism gets us all. MUST GET ON THAT GRIND and monetize all your hobbies, am I right ?

            <p id="inku">Wrote a lottt of articles under InksDen. You know how with freelance work, you have to gather and deal with clients and that's like the hardest part ? Well InksDen sort of did that for me, and acted as the mediator. We got clients from all over the world, writing for everything starting from tech to froggies to even the genders of tomatoes (yes, this was an actual article I had to write).

                The only catch here is, of course, we don't get credit, but we get paid. So none of these links have my name on them, but here are a few of the published articles I could find.</p>

                <p id="socialmedia">With my 11 hours of screentime, it's no wonder I end up somehow working in social media roles as well. During my Solve Climate by 2030 internship, I along with a team of 30 people, were in charge of managing our Facebook page. So, I had to write some of the captions and brain-storm ideas for posts as well. We managed to get 1K+ likes completely organically in a span of just 3 months! Apart from that I've had experience writing Training Manuals for new recruits at my very first job as a Client Expert at GradConnect. Not to mention, my regular incessant posts on Facebook. So a LOT of social media writing is under my belt and it's usually a lot of fun writing for social media content. Here's a link to our <u><a href="https://www.facebook.com/solveclimateby2030BD" target="_blank"> Facebook page</a></u> if you wanna check it out.

                <p>On the first day of university, there was this dude who came up to our class and gave each of us a copy of the university newspaper, BRACU Express. He seemed super cool back then, and that stuck in my head. Fast forward a few semesters, I ended up joining BRACU express as a journalist and writer and had an amazing time writing about various university news content as well as a few opinion pieces. When the term came to an end, I ended up being selected as an Editor as well. While I dreaded it at first, unsure of whether I was capable, I ended up making amazing memories. It's a little hard to find links to any of my actual work there, since it was primarily a newspaper in print, which eventually got a digital version as well during the pandemic, but you can check out the <u><a href="https://issuu.com/bracuexpress" target="_blank">archives</a></u> and <u><a href="https://bracuexpress.com/?fbclid=IwAR0gnbgRocHIVvPgh24OnrFLHklh22uAvKG5Dh333xr8LGBgQWupipJ9WNQ" target="_blank">recent work</a></u> of the current team if you want!



                    On a little side note, still related to newspapers. I did join The Financial Express as a freelance writer as well but somehow just wrote a single article which you can find <u><a href="https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/opinions/how-students-perceive-creativity-these-days-1612016512" target="_blank">here</a></u>. Wack, I know. But I guess I kept forgetting to check the group for assignments once I got busy with InksDen.</p>

                <p>I like making stuff. Whether it be crafts or cooking or random sewing projects,  master of none indeed. I also like making reels about making stuff. Here's just a collection of those on YouTube. They have better audio on Instagram, trust me. But my point is, I love content-creation :3 and have experience working with video editing and stuff using VSDC ( mostly InShot though lmao).</p>

                            <p>So I went to Willes Little Flower School and College. Best years of my life! Miss everything about that place. Didn't really study, but managed to be in the top 10 for some reason. The only times I've actually put in any effort into my education was during O Levels. And that sort of began to die down with A Levels. Then I gave up.</p>

                            <p>During A Levels, Physics was my favorite subject. But I was super lost on what major to choose going into University. Thank God, I didn't get into Physics because oh my god, do I suck at Math. Computer Science and Engineering seemed like a good enough option, considering the pros and cons and well capitalism and I would need a job. But since I had "given up" and didn't care about my grades, I barely got through university. The only time I studied and also enjoyed my course material was during my last semester with the AI course. But by then it was too late to save my CGPA of 3.31.</p>

You know how, when you have to open a LinkedIn account, you have to put in "what" you are i.e. what you do primarily. And I struggled so much with that. Firsly, because I don't associate my identity with what I do, but let's not get philosophical on a portfolio. Secondly, I studied(debatable) Computer Science, am trying to learn JS but work as a content writer (sometimes), but I also create content for nobody but my friends. Hmm, maybe humans are more multi-faceted than a single job title. idk idk. I hope it stays like this though. I hope I get to play with a lot of things, and maybe even master a few here and there. So, hi there. I'm farhin. It's nice to virtually meet you :3</p>
